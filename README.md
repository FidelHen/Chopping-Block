## Getting started

1. Make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed
2. Clone the project
3. Inside the cloned folder run 
    
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    
4. Install the Expo CLI
    
    ```bash
    npm install -g expo-cli
    ```
    
5. Run the application on an iOS emulator or physical device.

    ```
    
    *Windows OS does not support iOS emulators so you will have to run the application on a physical device*
